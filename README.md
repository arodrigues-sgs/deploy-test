# Harker-Hall-Rubric
Prototype site for Rubric Selection

This is a prototype type site that will hopefully envision what our end goal is for the May report cards.

The main features we are hoping for are:
1. A simple click to select for each expection in the rubric.
2. A way for the advisor, when finished, to push it to parents, students and harker hall admin.
